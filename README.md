## About the Data
My goal is to predict whether a mortgage application was accepted (meaning the loan was originated) or denied according to the given dataset, which is adapted from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC).

### Target Variable 
I am  trying to predict the variable `accepted `(a binary variable) for each row of the test data set.

My job is to:
*Train a model using the inputs in `train_values.csv` and the labels `train_labels.csv`
*Predict value for each row in `test_values.csv` for which i don't know the true value of accepted.
*Output My predictions in a format that matches `submission_format.csv` exactly.



## Submission Format
The format for the submission file is two columns with `row_id `and `accepted`. The data type of `accepted` is an integer, only valid values are 0 and 1.

If you predicted `1` accepted for each respondent, the `.csv `file that you submit would look like:
```
row_id,accepted
0,1
1,1
2,1
3,1
4,1
‚Åù 
```

## Performance Metric
We're predicting a binary variable, so this is a classification problem. To measure classification, we'll use a metric known as accuracy (also known as "classification rate"). Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right. For binary classification, accuracy can be calculated in terms of positives and negatives as follows:

# accuracy=(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
where TP means True Positives, TN means True Negatives, FP means False Positives, and FN means False Negatives.

##Features

There are 21 variables in this dataset. Each row in the dataset represents a HMDA-reported loan application, and the dataset we are working with covers one particular year.

We provide a unique identifier called `lender` for each individual loan-making institution.

The variables are as follows:

#PROPERTY LOCATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*`msa_md `(categorical) - A categorical with no ordering indicating Metropolitan Statistical Area/Metropolitan Division where a value of `-1 `indicates a missing value
* `state_code` (categorical) - A categorical with no ordering indicating the U.S. state where a value of `-1 `indicates a missing value
* `county_code` (categorical) - A categorical with no ordering indicating the county where a value of `-1 `indicates a missing value

#LOAN INFORMATION

* `lender `(categorical) - A categorical with no ordering indicating which of the lenders was the authority in approving or denying this loan

* `loan_amount` (int) - Size of the requested loan in thousands of dollars

* `loan_type `(categorical) - Indicates whether the loan granted, applied for, or purchased was conventional, government-guaranteed, or government-insured; available values are:

```
1 -- Conventional (any loan other than FHA, VA, FSA, or RHS loans)
2 -- FHA-insured (Federal Housing Administration)
3 -- VA-guaranteed (Veterans Administration)
4 -- FSA/RHS (Farm Service Agency or Rural Housing Service)
 
```
* `property_type` (categorical) - Indicates whether the loan or application was for a one-to-four-family dwelling (other than manufactured housing), manufactured housing, or multifamily dwelling; available values are:

#CENSUS INFORMATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*`population` - Total population in tract
*`minority_population_pct` - Percentage of minority population to total population for tract
*`ffiecmedian_family_income` - FFIEC Median family income in dollars for the MSA/MD in which the tract is located (adjusted annually by FFIEC)
*`tract_to_msa_md_income_pct` - % of tract median family income compared to MSA/MD median family income
*`number_of_owner-occupied_units` - Number of dwellings, including individual condominiums, that are lived in by the owner
*`number_of_1_to_4_family_units` - Dwellings that are built to house fewer than 5 families

#INDEX AND TARGET VARIABLE

*`row_id` - A unique identifier with no intrinsic meaning, but the IDs in your submission must match the submission format exactly
*`accepted` - Indicates whether the mortgage application was accepted (successfully originated) with a value of `1` or denied with a value of `0`

#Example Row

Here's an example of one of the rows in the dataset so that you can see the kinds of values you might expect in the dataset. Most are categorical, a few are numerical, and there can be missing values.
